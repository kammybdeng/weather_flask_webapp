# Weather Flask Application
A simple flask application that retrieves the weather of a given city by making API requests to a third party website, [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

The application was deployed with Heroku and hosted here:
https://weather-app100.herokuapp.com/

### Technologies Used
Flask, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS

### API limits
OpenWeatherMap API supports 60 calls within an hour. 
If you see an error in the website, this could mean that you have 
reached the limitation of API calls.


### Heroku limits
Heroku's free tier hosting server will sleep the server after 30 minutes of
inactivity. If it's your first time accessing the website please wait a 
couple minute for the server to load up.
